# Project 20 - Javascript Calculator

This is a JavaScript calculator designed to look like the **Apple calculator**.

The `Intl.NumberFormat` object is used for rendering numbers, and a variety of number rendering and validation functions have been implemented. The rendered number font adapts to the size of the display screen.

**For a bit of fun, try dividing numbers by zero and performing calculations with bigInt numbers, and do it several times.**

The app has light and dark modes, and the preferred mode is stored in local storage so that the next time a user visits the application, it will be rendered in the preferred mode.

It is responsive to all screen sizes, with only one media query.
